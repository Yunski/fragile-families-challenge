Preprocessing consisted of removing constants, NAs, and treating all 
negative values as missing data. 
Data imputation was done by mode imputing and KNN imputing. 
Categorical variables were converted to indicator variables and
continuous variables were normalized.

ElasticNet and RFE were used for feature selection, and PCA was used for
dimensionality reduction.

Models used include OLS, Logistic Regression, Ridge, AdaBoost, 
Random Forest, and SVM. 

We found that for 4/6 outcomes, Linear/Logistic Regression trained on 
features selected by ElasticNet performed the best.
